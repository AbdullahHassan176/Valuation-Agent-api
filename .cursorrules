# Cursor Rules — API (Valuation Agent Workspace)

GOAL
- FastAPI façade exposing deterministic endpoints for valuation, curves, data, and exports.
- Later, wrap QuantLib/Strata behind stable endpoints (no LLM logic here).
- Today: only /healthz placeholder exists.

RUNTIME
- PORT=9000

HOW TO RUN (later)
- uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000

DOCKER
- Built by parent docker-compose. Replace placeholder with real app later.

GUARDRAILS
- No agent logic here. Pure functions, strict schemas, reproducible outputs.
- Maintain versioning and lineage (data/model hashes) when implemented.
